# Japanese-to-English-DFA
A scanner, parser, and translator for Japanese romanji.

This program includes an implementation of a scanner, parser, and translator for Japanese romanji to English.

## Overview
DFA's were created for nearly all Japanese syllabus.
Common words were hard coded into an array to provide a starting place for basic Japanese sentences. 
hese words were assigned pre-defined types establishing what type of word it is.

The program scans a file containing the romanji words to see if it follow the rules for Japanese words.
Then, it checks to see if the sentence structure in the file follows Japanese rules.
Finally, using some basic predefined Japanese words, translates the romaji into English.
